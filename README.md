I created a class that reads data ( int, String, or Double data type) from a .txt file, sorts them out and stores the sorted data in another specified .txt file.
In the beginning, the scanner opens the input file and reads the first string that specifies the type of data that is following the string.
when launching the program, if we pass the string "reverse" as an argument to the main function, 
then our program sorts the data in reverse order and saves it in another output .txt file
