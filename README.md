In this Java Program I created a class that reads data ( int, String or Double) from a text file , sorts them out and stores the sorted data in another specified .txt file.
at the beggining the scanner opens the input file, and reads the first string that specifies the type of the data in the following lines,
this is done because sorting of different types of data needs different approaches.
when launching the program , if we pass the string "reverse" as an argument to the main function, 
then our program also sorts the data in reverse order and saves it in another output .txt file
